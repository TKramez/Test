Although God's Word is infallible, we can easily misunderstand it without proper interpretation, which is why we have the Magisterium of the Church.  Lastly, Fr.

He points out that the location of the Jordan River is particularly noteworthy because it's the same river that Joshua crossed over to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land, signifying that Jesus will bring about a new exodus. Additionally, it's the lowest spot on the planet, symbolizing Jesus' humility. Finally, Fr. Mike emphasizes that when we are baptized, we are adopted as beloved sons and daughters of God because what belongs to Jesus by his nature is given to us by God’s grace.

We learn that purgatory is a process of purification that our hearts need in order to be ready to love God and to enter into his presence. In our reading of Wisdom today, Fr. Mike emphasizes the insanity of worshipping idols and how it's more tempting to make idols out of good things rather than evil things. Today's readings are 2 Maccabees 12, Wisdom 13-14, and Proverbs 25:11-14.</itunes:subtitle>

In the story of the martyrdom of the seven brothers in 2 Macabees, we see how the brothers and their mother fiercely reject the temptation to violate God's law, and boldly hold onto their hope in the resurrection of the dead. Our readings from Wisdom also remind us that death is not the end, because we know that eternal life is waiting for us beyond death.

As we begin reading the book of Wisdom today, we also learn three valuable lessons;  God did not create death, death entered the world through sin, and we are wise when we walk in the truth but foolish when we walk in evil. Today's readings are 2 Maccabees 6, Wisdom 1-2, and Proverbs 24:21-26.</itunes:subtitle>

      <itunes:subtitle>Fr. Mike explains the beautiful connections between all of our readings today. He emphasizes how good shepherds are willing to face the truth, and also sacrifice for their sheep, like Jesus who laid down his life for us. In our reading of Jeremiah, Fr. Mike also explains that the experience of shame points to the reality that there is something good within us that ought not to be violated. Today we read Jeremiah 6, Ezekiel 34-35, and Proverbs 14:25-28.</itunes:subtitle>

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Fr. Mike reflects on how Isaiah&#39;s prophecies in chapters 49-50 point to the immediate reality of God&#39;s promise of redemption for Israel, as well as to the distant reality of Jesus Christ as the Messiah. In our reading of Ezekiel, we also learn how the glory of God departed from the temple, and how God&#39;s presence is often hidden from us as well. Today&#39;s readings are Isaiah 49-50, Ezekiel 10-11, and Proverbs 12:17-20.</p>

We also read about Ezekiel's vision of the temple and how the markings on the foreheads of the Israelites symbolizes the mourning of true worship, and also foreshadows Jesus' death on the Cross.

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Exile period! Jeff Cavins joins Fr. Mike to introduce the eighth biblical period, which covers the fall of the Southern Kingdom, Judah, and its exile into Babylon. They explain how the physical exile of Judah was representative of their spiritual realities, and ultimately oriented towards the healing and restoration of their unfaithfulness. We also learn about the role of prophets in this period. <br>

      <itunes:subtitle>Today we read about the critical moment when Assyria destroys the Northern Kingdom, and the ten northern tribes are exiled and assimilated among the nations. Fr. Mike explains how this moment and the foreign possession of Samaria is key in order to understand Jesus' encounter with the Samaritan woman in John 4. We also read about how the prophet Micah beautifully foreshadows the birth of Jesus. Today's readings are 2 Kings 17, Micah 5-7, and Psalm 140.</itunes:subtitle>

We learn that when we are faithful and courageous in small matters, we can face the giants in our bigger battles. Today&#39;s readings are 1 Samuel 17 and Psalm 12.</p>

      <itunes:subtitle>Fr. Mike points out how blessing something sets it apart for the purposes of God, and it is no longer meant for ordinary uses. So when we are filled with the spirit of God, our daily task becomes extraordinary, because it is consecrated to God. Today's readings are Exodus 30-31, Leviticus 22, and Psalm 115.</itunes:subtitle>
